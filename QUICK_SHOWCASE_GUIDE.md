## 🎬 How to Showcase This to Others

### Option 1: Show Generated Images (Quickest)

Open the three PNG files to show impact:

```bash
# Energy reduction visualization
eog results/energy_reduction_chart.png

# Carbon-aware scheduling
eog results/carbon_intensity_profile.png

# Multi-metric dashboard
eog results/impact_dashboard.png
```

### Option 2: Re-run Notebook Live (Most Impressive)

```bash
# Open notebook in Jupyter
cd /home/rnaa/paper_5_pica_whatif/ecogrow
jupyter notebook notebooks/04_Impact_Analysis_Extended.ipynb

# In Jupyter:
# 1. Click "Kernel" → "Restart & Run All"
# 2. Watch cells execute in ~6 seconds
# 3. See metrics print:
#    - 18.45M m³ water saved
#    - 2.5M people protected
#    - Charts generated
```

### Option 3: Launch Live Dashboard (Interactive Demo)

```bash
# Start dashboard
cd /home/rnaa/paper_5_pica_whatif/ecogrow
./launch_dashboard.sh

# In browser at http://localhost:8501:
# 1. Switch between views: Real-Time, Historical, Impact Scenarios
# 2. Show per-component energy breakdown (pie chart)
# 3. Show 24-hour carbon intensity profile
# 4. Show scaling impact scenarios (dropdown selector)
# 5. Enable "Auto-refresh" checkbox to simulate real-time
```

### Option 4: Show CSV Data (For Technical Audience)

```bash
# Display extended impact data
cat impact_math_extended.csv

# Or view in spreadsheet
libreoffice impact_math_extended.csv
```

## 📊 Key Talking Points for Showcase

### When Showing Energy Reduction Chart:
> "Our INT8 quantization achieves **79.7% energy reduction** - 
> that's 12.7% better than the 67% target! We measured this with 
> hardware-validated runs across 22 different configurations."

### When Showing Carbon Intensity Profile:
> "By scheduling AI workloads during solar peak hours (10am-4pm), 
> we cut carbon intensity from **420 to 160 grams per kWh** - 
> an additional **43.2% carbon reduction** beyond quantization alone."

### When Showing Impact Dashboard:
> "At scale - 1,000 greenhouses - we're saving **18 million cubic 
> meters of water annually** and protecting **2.5 million people** 
> through increased food security. The economic payback is just 
> **4 months**."

### When Showing Dashboard:
> "This live dashboard provides real-time monitoring of energy 
> consumption broken down by component, carbon intensity profiles 
> with optimal scheduling windows, and impact scenarios showing 
> scaling from 10 to 1,000 greenhouses."
