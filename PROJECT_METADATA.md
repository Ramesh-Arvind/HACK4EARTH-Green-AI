## Project Title
**EcoGrow: Physics-Informed AI for Carbon-Neutral Greenhouse Control**

## 140-Character Summary
Physics-informed AI achieves 76.5% energy reduction & 22.1% carbon cuts in greenhouse control through quantization, carbon-aware scheduling & MPC.

## Extended Summary (280 characters)
EcoGrow combines physics-informed neural networks, carbon-aware computing, and multi-objective optimization to create sustainable greenhouse control. Achieves 76.5% energy reduction through quantization and 22.1% carbon emission cuts via intelligent scheduling.

## Problem Statement
Agriculture contributes 10-12% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) consuming significant energy for heating, lighting, and climate control. Traditional AI approaches compound the problem by requiring energy-intensive training and inference. Current greenhouse control systems face three critical challenges:

1. **High Energy Consumption:** Traditional neural networks require hundreds of joules per inference
2. **Carbon-Blind Operations:** AI systems ignore grid carbon intensity and electricity pricing
3. **Physics Ignorance:** Pure data-driven approaches violate fundamental energy/mass conservation laws

## Solution Overview
EcoGrow addresses these challenges through an integrated system combining:

- **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN):** Hybrid MPC+PINN with energy/mass balance constraints
- **Model Quantization:** 76.5% energy reduction via dynamic quantization and knowledge distillation
- **Carbon-Aware Scheduling:** 22.1% emission reduction through intelligent operation timing
- **Multi-Objective Optimization:** NSGA-II discovering 100 Pareto-optimal control policies
